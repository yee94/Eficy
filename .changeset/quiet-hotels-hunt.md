ðŸŽ‰ Eficy jsx is now available! Eficy is a no-compilation JSX rendering engine for React components. As LLMs become increasingly capable at generating HTML web pages, Eficy bridges the gap by providing a way to render React components without compilation barriers. Originally built as a low-code rendering engine, Eficy now fully supports JSX rendering in non-compilation environments, enabling LLMs to generate precise, concise pages with just one sentence.
